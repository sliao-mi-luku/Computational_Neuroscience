**2. First order linear differential equations**

> dV/dt = -(1/tau){g_L(V-E_L) + g_e(V-E_e) + g_i(V-E_i)}

- Shunting effect of GABAa synapses: they short circuit the depolarizing current produced by EPSPs.
- Nonlinear interaction between EPSPs and IPSPs. Only when these synapses are far apart can make the effect subtractive.

**3. Two-dimensional systems and state space**

- Two-component system
